# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately via GitHub's
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/thomasfosterau/effect-jsonapi/security/advisories/new)
button (Security → Advisories), **not** through public issues.

You can expect an initial response within a few days. Please include a
description, reproduction steps, and the affected version.

## Supply-chain hardening

This package is published with a hardened, automated pipeline designed to resist
supply-chain attacks (e.g. self-propagating npm worms that steal credentials and
publish trojanized versions):

- **No long-lived npm token.** Releases use npm
  [**OIDC Trusted Publishing**](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers): GitHub
  Actions proves its identity to npm with a short-lived, workflow-bound OIDC token.
  There is no `NPM_TOKEN` secret to steal from CI. The publish step uses the npm CLI
  directly (`npm publish`), since pnpm does not yet support OIDC trusted publishing.
- **Provenance.** Every published version carries
  [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements),
  cryptographically linking the artifact to the exact source commit and workflow.
- **Install scripts disabled in CI.** Both CI and the release workflow install
  dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`, so a
  compromised (transitive) dependency cannot execute install hooks in a privileged job.
- **Pinned actions.** All GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs, so a
  hijacked tag cannot inject malicious workflow code.
- **Least privilege.** Workflows default to `permissions: {}`; each job opts into
  only the scopes it needs. CI checks out with `persist-credentials: false`.
- **Manual approval gate.** Publishing runs in a protected `release` environment
  that requires manual approval.
- **Locked dependencies.** Installs use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` against the
  committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`; Dependabot proposes updates for review.

## Release pipeline

The publishing pipeline and its one-time maintainer setup (trusted publisher,
protected `release` environment, branch protection) are documented in
[PUBLISHING.md](./PUBLISHING.md).
